* a final_product folder
  * add your final product description and reflection 
  * add your presentation files or a link to your presentation - suggested areas to cover in `slides.pptx` (use this as a template, a guide, or just inspiration - it is not a requirement to answer all questions)

# "Submit"

When you are ready to "submit" - please create a new branch called `hacked-la-2022_{your team name}`. If you have time, please replace this README with your project description (you can use [README_template.md](final_product/README_template.md) as a template).
