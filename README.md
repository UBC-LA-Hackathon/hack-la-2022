# 2022 Fall Learning Analytics Hackathon - Course Performance Analysis
The project is to help the instructors analyze the courser performance. Currently, there is a built-in analytic tool on Canvas called New Analytics. It provides some analytics insights yet it has a major limitation: there is a 24 to 40 hrs delay on the analytics results. Our goal is to use Canvas API data to help instructors to look at the real-time analytics results, improving the course structure for next year.

# Who we are
Members: Kristy Yu, Alison Liu, Christopher Lin, Aman Sharma, and Atul Singh

# Prototype of current output
* An automated python script: Instructors can use this file to convert the raw data from Cavas API to 3 combined csv files for tableau data input.
* Tableau dashboard: With the data from python script, instructors can look for the infomration on the Tableau dashboard for free.

# Potential future function:
* Apply machine learning model to predict learners' behaviors and scores
